# Weather Dashboard

## Description:

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard to see the weather outook of multiple cities for travel planning.
### This will completed by...

- [x] When searching a city, the site will return current and future weather conditions for that city
- [x] The city will be added to a visible search history
- [x] Current conditions
  - [x] The site will display the city name, date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index (color coded for severity)
- [x] Future conditions
  - [x] The site will display a five-day forecast, date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity
- [x] Clicking on a city in the search history will re-display that city's weather conditionsour initials and score

### Notes
- Search history saves the 10 most recent searches

### Resources
- This will be implemented with nested API calls
  - [Mapquest OpenGeoCodingAPI](http://open.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/v1/address)
  - [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
- The OpenWeather One Call API requires a latitude and longitude, not a placename
- The Mapquest API has a robust database for making very generic place searches and return a latitude and longitude

- [Moment JS](momentjs.com)
